### Online Coursepack and YouTube Channel
{: .no_toc }

Online Coursepack @ [https://sde-coursepack.github.io/](http://sde-course.com/)

There is no official textbook for the course that you need to purchase.  We are creating our own online coursepack using the video content we created during COVID, which is available at [https://www.cs3240.org](https://www.cs3240.org).  Note that we are creating this as we go along during the semester, but will do our best to stay ahead of the pace of the class.

Youtube playlist is coming and will up soon.

### Discord
{: .no_toc }

We will be using Discord for the following:

* Online team forming, meetings and discussions
* In-class chat during lectures
* Off-topic channels for general discussion

We will not be using Discord for:

* Office-Hours : All office-hours will be *in-person only*
* Code debugging
* Course questions
* Long-form assignment questions / help (use Piazza or go to office hours)
* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)
* Direct messaging the staff about code questions, etc. (use Piazza)
* Direct messaging the faculty about sensitive / grading issues (use Piazza or email)

More information about joining our Discord server will be available in Collab at the start of the semester.

### Piazza
{: .no_toc }

Piazza @ [https://piazza.com/class/ksgd48h3znp1p](https://piazza.com/class/ksgd48h3znp1p)    

Think of Discord as stopping by for a quick chat, for a meeting, or for hanging out, while Piazza is for submitting significant help requests or questions.

We will be using Piazza for the following:

* Long-form questions about the class, code, or project (please post all code privately!)
* Private messages for faculty or the entire staff
* A searchable repository of common questions in the course about the project, assignments, etc.

We will not be using Piazza for:

* Any code debugging for *any* reason. All code related questions must be in office hours only.
* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)
* Meme posting (use Discord :-) )

### Email
{: .no_toc }

We will be using email for the following:

* Personal issues that can and should only be handled by a professor

We will not be using email for:

* Regrades (use Gradescope first, then office hours only if not resolved)
* Tech help (use Piazza)
* Project questions (use Piazza)
* Guided Practice questions (use Piazza)

12:30 students should email McBurney, while 2:00 students should email Nguyen.  You do not need to CC the other professor; we will get the other person involved if necessary.  _PLEASE_ make sure to put "[SDE]" at the beginning of the subject line somewhere so we can keep track of your request!  And please be patient with us in responding.  We both receive A LOT of email and it's easy to get behind.  If there is a time-critical nature to your note, please let us know that as well.

### Who do I ask about...?
{: .no_toc }

* Lecture chat -> Discord
* Team meetings -> Discord
* Concept questions (git, assignment clarifications, lecture topics) -> Piazza or TA office hours (NOTE: NOT professor office hours!)
* Coding/debugging help -> Office hours
* Regrades -> Gradescope only
* Personal issues -> Email your professor

### Course Requirements
{: .no_toc }
You should meet the following requirements to take this class:

1. __Prerequisite: CS 2100 - C- or higher
2. __Prerequisite knowledge: Proficiency with the Java programming language, including:
   1. Basic java syntax around variables, functions, conditionals, and loops
   2. Understanding of object oriented programming, including creating your own classes, polymorphism (inheritance and interfaces), the Object class
   3. Common data structures, especially List (ArrayList and LinkedList), Map (HashMap), Set (HashSet, TreeSet)
3. Willing to attend and participate with in-person lectures.
4. Start homework assignments early, and emphasize working incrementally over several days rather than cramming.
5. Participate to the best of your ability in discussions in class, on Discord, or on Piazza
6. Be a meaningful contributor to your assignment team.

## Assessment and Grading
{: .no_toc }
Grading in this class will be based one:
* Homework Assignments (7) - 60%
* Quizzes (8) - 5%
* Midterms (2) - 10% each
* Cumulative Final Exam (1) - 15%

The class will have one *minor* extra credit opportunity on the final assignment. This
will be a very difficult optional feature to add to the final assignment, and will only
account for ~0.8% of your final grade. There will be no other extra credit opportunities
for any reason.

### Assignments
{: .no_toc }
There will be 7 homeworks assignments. These assignments will be mostly Java programming
assignments. 

#### Assignment Teams
{: .no_toc }
All assignments are designed to be done collaboratively. Assignments have a cap of 2 or 3 people, depending on the assignment.
Rules on assignment teams:
1. You can only work with a specific person on **4 assignments** or less. You may not work with someone on 5 or more assignments.
2. All team members must join that team's Github repository. All assignment work is commited, shared, and submitted via Github.
3. Everyone on a given team gets the same grade for their assignment, **no exceptions.**
4. Once you have added someone to your team, you cannot remove them **for any reason** for that assignment. If someone on your team hasn't contributed, you are encouraged to let the professor know, as well as not work with that person in the future.
5. You are welcome to work alone. However, the assignment requirements will be the same, regardless of group size. Individual programmers will not be given any leniency on deadlines, grading, etc.

#### Late Policy
{: .no_toc } Most assignments may be submitted up to one week late at a penalty of 7% per calendar day (note that this penalty is subtractive, meaning if you score 85%, but it is one day late, you will get 78%).
All members of an assignment team will get the same late penalty, regardless of contribution (as all members of an assignment team get the same grade on the assignment). After 7 days, submissions will be accepted at 50% off until the end of the term. However, submissions more than one week late will not be graded until the end of the term.

The following assignments have different late policies:
1. Homework 1 Part A - no late submissions - Homework 1A is forming groups and having everyone add their name to the Readme on Github. It is a small portion (5%) of the final assignment grade, but ensures everyone has joined the class Github Classroom.
2. Homework 1 Part B - no late submissions - Homework 1 part B and C are closely related. As such, Homework 1B cannot be accepted late. Homework 1B is only 15% of the homework 1 final score, and is graded largely on completing basic functionality.
3. Homework 7 - no late submissions after the final calendar day of class - In order to ensure students have time to study for final exams, no late submissions of homework 7 (the final homework) will be accepted after the last day of class.

Generally, no extensions will be granted on assignments. This is because each assignment is laddered with specific course content. Additionally, assignments are generally released when the previous assignment is due, and so you should switch to focus on the new assignment.

If there is a serious issue that requires a prolonged absence, you should contact your professor. However, because all assignments are team-oriented, and work can be shared remotely over Git, extensions are unlikely to be granted for illness.

Extensions will **never** be granted for the following reasons:
1. Workload/exams in other courses
2. Computer issues or installation issues
3. Office hours was busy the day the assignment was due
4. Teammate has not participated
5. The last assignment was submitted late, so you couldn't start on the current assignment on time.

#### Homework collaboration policy
**You should at no point see any submitted work (code, question answers, etc.) from any other team for any reason.** This simple rule is the basis of our collaboration policy. In this course, you will work with 1-2 other people on homework assignments.
Obviously, you will be sharing code with these people over Git. Only the following people may look at your homework code for any reason:
1. The professors
2. The TAs
3. Your team members

No one else should look at your code for any reason.

Acceptable collaboration between teams is allowed. However, as a general rule, all collaboartion should be "pencils down". That is, if 
you are being so specific in your discussion that you feel you need to write something down, you are probably being too specific. You can,
however, discuss any of the following:
* General algorithms/data structures to use for some part of the function
* Design strategies for the assignment
* External libraries you found helpful.

Submissions in this course will be checked using cheat detection software. If it is found that you shared code, **intentionally or unintentionally** with
another team.

#### Homework external resources policy
{: .no_toc }
**You are allowed to use external resources** like StackOverflow, Geeksforgeeks, etc. for looking up help with **individual parts** of your assignments (such
as how to read a JSON file in Java, etc.). However, **you may not copy large portions of external source code** from online. If
you find you are copying more than 5 lines or so, you should stop. **All external references must be cited!** Do not "forget" to cite your
sources. If it's found your team and another team submitted nearly identical code, and neither of you cited the external source,
both teams will be considered to have copied from one another.

#### How to Cite Code
{: .no_toc }
Use the following format as an example citing code you use. You may not have all of these fields available, but this should give you a good idea of things to look for.  Order by title of the software package.  Use the appropriate commenting format for the programming language of your source code.  Below is a genearl example of a citation format.  Does yours have to look *exactly* like this?  No, nor does it have to have all the fields.  It does have to have enough to give the proper credit and so we can find the resource if needed.

```
//  URL: <where it's located>
//  Description: <what you used, be very specific with line numbers>
```

#### Homework academic honesty violations

If it is found your submission violates our policies outline above, you will receive the following penalties:

**1st offense:** 0 on the assignment, plus an additional subtractive deduction to your final course grade up to 10% depending on severity.
**2nd offense:** F in the course

Depending on severity and at instructor discretion, you may be referred to Honor Committee for any violation, including the first.

### Quizzes
There will be occassional quizzes in the class which are meant to ensure basic understanding of the course lecture material.
Quizzes will be posted on Collab, and are multiple choice. Quizzes are graded in a pass/fail way. Any score >= 80% is considered a
passing score. Any score below 80% is considered a fail. **Quizzes can be taken as many times as needed** to achieve the target score.

You will be able to see your total quiz score after submitting. However, you won't see specifically what you got right/wrong, or the correct
answer until after the quiz closes.

If you pass at least 7 quizzes, you will be given 100% credit for the quiz portion of the grade.

Quizzes are **individual assignments**. Collaboration/working together (even with assignment team members for homeworks) is strictly prohibited.
If collaboration is discovered, it will result in all parties involved receiving a zero on their entire quiz grade for the course.

### Midterms
There will be two non-cumulative midterms during the course.

Midterm 1: Tuesday, September 29, 2022, in-class
    -Covers all material from start of class up to and including September 22
Midterm 2: Thursday, November 3, 2022, in-class
    -Covers all material from September 29 up to and including November 1

If you know you will be absent for an exam, you must let your professor know with at least **1-week's notice**. 

Exams are **in-person**, closed note, closed book, closed laptop, pencil and paper. Those with extended time or other accommodations should contact your professor to discuss them during the first two weeks of the class.

### Cumulative Final Exam
The course final exam is cumulative, covering all material from the semester. There will be an emphasis on material covered after Midterm 2, but all content from the course is considered "fair game."

The final exams scheduled for:

12:30 p.m. Section (McBurney): Monday, December 12, 2-5p.m.
03:30 p.m. Section (Nguyen): Saturday, December 10, 9a.m. to 12 noon

**You must attend the section you are registered for**. If you attend the wrong final exam section, your final exam will be given a zero.

UVA has strict final exam policies. As such, we cannot grant make-ups or alternative exam time without explicitly permission from and notification to a Dean. As such, we will not give a make-up exam for the following under **any circumstances**:
1. Planned Travel (expect to be in Charlottesville during your exam time.
2. Multiple exams within the same time period - This course is in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. As such, we do not have a "maximum number of exams within a 24-hour period policy". We cannot reschedule exams for this reason with explicit, documented accommodations.

Any requests for make-ups due to illness must be made through your Dean, and we cannot handle them ourselves.

Exams are **in-person**, closed note, closed book, closed laptop, pencil and paper. Those with extended time or other accommodations should contact your professor to discuss them during the first two weeks of the class.

## Class Management

### Attendance
{: .no_toc }
* No attendance will be taken during the live lectures sessions on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  
* Students are encouraged to attend the section they registered for. However, you may attend the other section's lecture occassionally as needed.
* Zoom sessions will be recorded and made available through the Online Meetings tool in Collab.  **However, recordings will not include material written on the board, and may lose audio when the speaker needs to walk away from the microphone**
  * Recordings are not an alternative to attending class

## This Syllabus
{: .no_toc }
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.

## Professionalism
{: .no_toc }
In this course, there will be a focus on working well together and learning about the development process. A large portion of that process involves interpersonal skills and conflict management. Students and staff are all expected to treat each other with respect.  This includes, but certainly is not limited to:

* Misuse of class platforms (Discord, Piazza, YouTube comments, etc.)
* Disrespectful language or actions to course staff or other students
* Promptness for all deadlines and class meetings
* Quality work
* Not working well with your partners
* Collaborating with other teams
* Not following University health regulations

Students can and will be penalized for unprofessional behavior with deductions to their final grade.

## Academic Integrity
_Summary_:

* Know the honor code
* Work with your team, but not any other team
* Using code from other students (from any semester) is an honor violation
* Using publicly-available example code and libraries is fine, but you must cite your resources
* More information on what is allowed will be included with each assignment if necessary
* It never hurts to ask the staff what is allowed or not allowed!

The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 

Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud [http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud](http://honor.virginia.edu/academic-fraud). Assessments will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you have questions on what is allowable, ask! Unless otherwise noted, all assessments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam, assignment, or project to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Sending, receiving, or otherwise copying or describing the contents of electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks. 

For CS3140, using code developed by previous students in the course or code written for your use by someone outside the course is not allowed and will likely be an honor violation. This does not apply to the use of publicly available frameworks and libraries, unless indicated in the assessment instructions.

In general, we expect that you will be using code, examples, and ideas from many different websites and resources for your projects.  This is allowed within reason.  Wholesale copying of an entire project or any major feature from any source (the web, another student, etc.) is definitely not allowed.  Using code snippts that you find to round out a feature is allowed.  If you ever have a question about what is or is not appropriate, ask first!

In ALL cases, you need to cite all sources at the top of the file where the code or algorithm was used AND you should note all sources in your documentation.  Failure to properly attribute your sources will result in a 50% penalty for the project at a minimum.


## Miscellaneous Policies

### Inclement Weather Policy
{: .no_toc }
If there is the possibility of inclement weather that could affect class, it is your responsibility to stay informed.  Information about how to sign up for email and/or text alerts from UVA Emergency Management, along with the current University status, can be found at [https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/](https://uvaemergency.virginia.edu/).

### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180 or [sdac@virginia.edu](mailto:sdac@virginia.edu). If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at [http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff).

If you have been identified as an SDAC student, please let the SDAC know you are taking this class.  We happily and discretely provide the recommended accommodations for those students identified by the SDAC. Please contact us one week before an exam so we can make accommodations.

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.), please contact the instructor as soon as you know these may affect you in class.

### Religious Accommodations
{: .no_toc }
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University’s Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at [UVAEOCR@virginia.edu](UVAEOCR@virginia.edu) or 434-924-3200. 

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance.

### Statement on Violence
{: .no_toc }
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:
 
1. Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated. 
2. Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
 
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - [www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence](http://www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence). 
 
As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See [http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf](http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf)). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help.
