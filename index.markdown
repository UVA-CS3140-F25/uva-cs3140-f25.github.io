### A note for students on the wait-list
In consultation with the department, I prioritize some students on the wait list based on need. The priority list is as follows:

1. BSCS Majors 3rd Year and higher
2. BACS Majors 3rd Year and higher (lower because CS 3240 is required for BSCS, but optional for BACS)
3. 4th year CS Minors
4. 2nd year CS Majors (BS or BA)
5. 3rd year Minors
6. 2nd year Minors
7. All other students

Be aware that I must act based on what is visible on SIS. As such, if you are still listed as undeclared, I must treat you as "all other students." I will add as many students as I can by the add deadline. Please check your email regularly, as I will email your UVA address if you are permitted to enroll.

The Course add deadline is Jan 31st. If registered students decide to drop the class, I will immediately fill their spots with students waiting to get in!
